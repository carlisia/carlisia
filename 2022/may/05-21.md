# May 21st, Saturday

Started the day working on the [[gh queries]] [gh-queries · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/carlisia/07fa820be5e38d173b274ca8be67de39). Started looking into how to decouple data source from formatting.

Looked at the gistpad vscode extension to transfer some notes there, was worried some local notes were not being backed up.

Learned that gistpad now has a wiki type of repo. Learned how to use it, as well as the gistlog micro blog. Got me thinking I could use this to log my work. 🤔

Not sure how but found Foam. it integrates with gistpad, it's perfect for the worklog! Spent a lot of time formatting the autogenerated date for file name and title. Found a great theme to go with it. Got it up on gh pages 🙌
