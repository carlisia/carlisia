## Assessments
### Positives
- [[positives]] over the weekend I stumbled across a cool microsite that works in the roamresearch style of notes, which I've been using for over a year. I had been thinking about logging my work in public but a website or blog for that felt way too heavy. Turned out this was the tool I didn't know I needed! Really happy with the flow of adding and moving things about. The structure looks amazing, love the backlinks, and I was already making use of that with other tools (roam/amplenote/drafts)
- [[positives]] at least, "for fun", I worked on the [[gh-queries]]/scripts to fetch PRs on the command line. Made great progress. It's gonna be great to be able to avoid the browser all together. Specially happy that I can can link the PR from the terminal directly into vscode, and do code reviews in the IDE, being able to checkout the code, etc. ran into a potential issue with the [[owners-file]] and PR/labeling automation. Have added a todo to investigate this further.

### Negatives
- [[negatives]] another failed week at planning. ppl were out for KubeconEU and I got into the "I'll do the important work later", which meant doing the work and also the deciding, and that... wasn't great.
### Reflections
- [[reflections]] after spending the weekend building this worklog, I realize how powerful it is for me to have all my incoming work under one context, like an catch-all inbox, in a way that I can write and easilly and quickly move things about as much as I need to. I also realize that making my work more public can sorta be an antidote to isolation. I am very motivated to keep up with this log!
- [[reflections]] talking about incoming work, I also realized this week that I have not been treating my 1.1s as inboxes. Action items from those meetings were going into notes but never surfacing during "planning". I have also not been blocking time in the calendar to do [[pr-reviews]] and issue triage. These have been happening adhoc.
- [[reflections]] mind boggling realization this week was that I raise my hand to do things that I "think" are helpful to other people, but that I actually find super boring. Aaaaaand I feel like I have to do these first before I get to the stuff **I** like (like coding 🙄), this gets me into such a jam. I got four great tips this week from my adhd coaching to handle tackling boring tasks:
    - this one is actually from me: stop raising my hand for boring tasks ◕_◕
    - do the fun task(s) first, or intercalate them; something to do with my brain needing way more dopamine than the regular Jane
    - mark todos as fun/boring as I add them to my inbox, so when I plan I can pick and choose in a way that doesn't go against my brain +
    - tasks that I have a hard time starting are very likely sending me a signal that I don't know where to start. I should mark and identify these separately so I can ask for help.
- [[reflections]] and the best reflection of this week: I have been fretting a bit because there is "just too much to do". Then I remembered that I worked soooo hard to be in a position to ***HAVE CHOICES***. I am now feeling grateful about all of my todos! And for sure, I will never get all of them done. It is SO okay!
