# May 22nd, Sunday

- how should I structure the directories for the worklog, have a directory for years?
  - yes. I can have an `about` top level file to map projects x year timeframe when change happens.
- should sat and sun belong to the following week's log, or the week before? 🙇‍♀️
  - week before! Doing it this way keeps all daily logs for the week grouped together before the week log file for that week.

## todos
- ✅ fix the macro for the daily page
- ✅ fix directory structure to have only yearly directories
- [ ] fix landing page for worklog
  - ✅ update gatsby theme dependency references manually
  - yeay I am now running mpm locally, building packages omg no
- ✅ move worklog to the `carlisia` repo to have its readme show in the gh profile
- [ ] plan for this week, look at [[inbox]]
