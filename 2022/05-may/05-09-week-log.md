## Assessments
### Positives
- [[positives]] I really hope folks get promoted and, thought there is no way to know, I love thinking that my feedback and endorsements were positive contributions. 💼
- [[positives]] loved doing the research to spec out the [[gateway-api]] [Indicate a new Route "Readiness" condition · Issue #1156 · kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1156). There were a lot of comments spread throughout different issues, and distilling an idea to its core concepts is sorta my super power. 🥰

### Negatives
- [[negatives]] spent a day side tracked looking at career stuff, unplanned 😞
### Reflections
- [[reflections]] not so much planning as trying to come up with "the right" tasks to tackle as the week progressed. planning, deciding, and acting are three modes that go better when really well separated. (⊙.☉)7
- [[reflections]] realized when voting for the Knative [[TOC]] that it is really hard not to have a positive biased toward the people I know, regardless of how carefully I read their submissions, and how well-written those were. 🥵
