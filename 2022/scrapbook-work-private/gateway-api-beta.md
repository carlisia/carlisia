[[EA]][[06-01]]
> Hey, chatting with some of the other TAP folks, I’d like to set a goal that we get net-gateway-api to beta in Knative in time for the 1.6 release (12 July 2022) for inclusion in [[tap]] 1.3 (2 Sep 2022). This should un-block integration testing with Avi and Tanzu Service Mesh, which have been customer requests but aren’t really reasonable for upstreamto test.
> If you drop all your other responsibilities (and do some pairing with Dave), do you think that’s achievable? It would look like:

- Define the beta requirements
- Break down into tasks
- Track the tasks on a GitHub project
- Have parity between Istio & Contour via Gateway API
- Documentation on Knative.dev about installing via Gateway
- Integration tests (probably in Serving) to detect backsliding

could also be a supply chain that uses the kantive net-gw-api
wrt the httproute stuff that does not use knative

- When is gateway going to go beta and ga?
- list we need to do to keep up with compatibility so knative can also declare  that?
- getting knative run continuously in the upstream integration tests
- would be nice to retire the knative tests in favor of just running the gw-api test, but gw-api needs to be ga

## Questions
[[MF]] [[05-05]]
- how does the httproute get configured?
  - httproute is a gw api object.
- are we at the point where contour and istio can be swapped?
- how do the optional features of gw-api get surfaced and configured in knative?
- open api specs - are they going to follow it?  @questions
  - it would be useful at the knative level? to have it associated with the knative route?
    - knative route might be needed for things like indicating readiness
- will the knative http route resource
- what does knative bring to the table post gw-api @questions
  - revisions management
  - map services to multiple http routes
  - something to tie the routing configuration and revisions together
  - service is the single entry point
    - but, could stampout http route as opposed to knative http route

03-10
how will knative configuration work with say contour, able to pass thru the configuration
  - does it have any additional configuration?
  - non knative deployments could also use the httproute config
  - gke - document fir installing knative
