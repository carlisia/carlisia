## Assessments
### Positives
- [[positives]] discovered [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), and it's awesome!
- [[positives]] ran this type of command: `go get sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api@main` for the first time, felt like magic!
  - `go: downloading sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api v0.5.0-rc1.0.20220629164606-6f51a1a8ab47`
  - `go: upgraded sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api v0.5.0-rc1 => v0.5.0-rc1.0.20220629164606-6f51a1a8ab47`
- [[positives]] really feeling like a `$bash` ninja! ü•∑
- [[positives]] felt great to spruce up both the docs and the bash test scripts in the [[net-gateway-api]] repo.


### Negatives
- [[negatives]] still did not merge [Bump Gateway API version to v0.5.0-rc1](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/306). What's so hard with an update, they say! „Éü‚óèÔπè‚òâ„Éü. More:
  - as seen from last week's negatives, running `./hack/update-codegen.sh` was not generating any code. At all. **on my machine** [see desc](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/pull/311?w=1#issuecomment-1167408724)
    - took a long time to catch on to this and more time trying to resolve it - still don't know
    - suspected was machine related since running the same script in the `serving` repo also didn't generate anything when I tweaked things so it should
    - low and behold I discover Codespace, and it worked there! (thanks [@dprotaso](https://github.com/dprotaso))
  - [[negatives]] once I was able to generate code for the `v0.5.0-rc1` of the Gateway API, ran into this issue: [Generated injection code is broken when there's a mismatch in type ¬∑ Issue #2537 ¬∑ knative/pkg](https://github.com/knative/pkg/issues/2537) - ([fixed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1239?w=1)).
  - [[negatives]]  spent some time getting go mod `replace` directive entirely wrong before I got it right (aka [@dprotaso](https://github.com/dprotaso) pointed it out to me). This was needed because:
    -  `v0.5.0-rc1` of the Gateway API uses `v0.24.1` of `k8s.io` stuff, but Knative is still on `v0.23.8`, so we needed to pin those to the earlier version.
    -  so I guess I am full on go mod expert now.
 - [[negatives]] added unplanned work to the PR because it did not make sense to merge w/o them: refactored the test scripts, improved the documentation

### Reflections
- [[reflections]] omg the bash scripts all the way down the stack on [[knative]] are not for the faint of heart!!!!! 0__# and... I love it? ¬Ø\(¬∞_o)/¬Ø
- [[reflections]] listened to [Tetrate Tech Talks - Fireside chat on Envoy Gateway - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ynXQ753p_Q)
- [[reflections]] listened to [Tech Talks Episode 11: Let's talk service mesh, with Kelsey Hightower - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3nuGTbF-Is)
