### [[05-16-week-log]]
- [[negatives]] another failed week at planning. ppl were out for KubeconEU and I got into the "I'll do the important work later", which meant doing the work and also the deciding, and that... wasn't great.
- [[positives]] at least, "for fun", I worked on the [[gh queries]]/scripts to fetch PRs on the command line. Made great progress. It's gonna be great to be able to avoid the browser all together. Specially happy that I can can link the PR from the terminal directly into vscode, and do code reviews in the IDE, being able to checkout the code, etc. ran into a potential issue with the [[notes/owners file]] and PR/labeling automation. Have added a todo to investigate this further.
- [[positives]] over the weekend I stumbled across a cool microsite that works in the roamresearch style of notes, which I've been using for over a year. I had been thinking about logging my work in public but a website or blog for that felt way too heavy. Turned out this was the tool I didn't know I needed! Really happy with the flow of adding and moving things about. The structure looks amazing, love the backlinks, and I was already making use of that with other tools (roam/amplenote/drafts)
- [[reflections]] after spending the weekend building this worklog, I realize how powerful it is for me to have all my incoming work under one context [[inbox]] in a way that I can write and easilly and quickly move things about as much as I need to. I also realize that making my work more public can sorta be an antidote to isolation. I am very motivated to keep up with this log!
- [[reflections]] talking about incoming work, I also realized this week that I have not been treating my 1.1s as inboxes. Action items from those meetings were going into notes but never surfacing during "planning". I have also not been blocking time in the calendar to do [[pr reviews]] and issue triage. These have been happening adhoc.
- [[reflections]] mind boggling realization this week was that I raise my hand to do things that I "think" are helpful to other people, but that I actually find super boring. Aaaaaand I feel like I have to do these first before I get to the stuff **I** like (like coding ðŸ™„), this gets me into such a jam. I got four great tips this week from my [[notes/adhd]] to handle tackling boring tasks:
    - this one is actually from me: stop raising my hand for boring tasks â—•_â—•
    - do the fun task(s) first, or intercalate them; something to do with my brain needing way more dopamine than the regular Jane
    - mark todos as fun/boring as I add them to my inbox, so when I plan I can pick and choose in a way that doesn't go against my brain +
    - tasks that I have a hard time starting are very likely sending me a signal that I don't know where to start. I should mark and identify these separately so I can ask for help.
- [[reflections]] and the best reflection of this week: I have been fretting a bit because there is "just too much to do". Then I remembered that I worked soooo hard to be in a position to ***HAVE CHOICES***. I am now feeling grateful about all of my todos! And for sure, I will never get all of them done. It is SO okay!

### [[05-09-week-log]]
- [[negatives]] spent a day side tracked looking at career stuff, unplanned ðŸ˜ž
- [[reflections]] not so much planning as trying to come up with "the right" tasks to tackle as the week progressed. planning, deciding, and acting are three modes that go better when really well separated. (âŠ™.â˜‰)7
- [[reflections]] realized when voting for the Knative [[TOC]] that it is really hard not to have a positive biased toward the people I know, regardless of how carefully I read their submissions, and how well-written those were. ðŸ¥µ
- [[positives]] I really hope folks get promoted and, thought there is no way to know, I love thinking that my feedback and endorsements were positive contributions. ðŸ’¼
- [[positives]] loved doing the research to spec out the [[gateway-api]] [Indicate a new Route "Readiness" condition Â· Issue #1156 Â· kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1156). There were a lot of comments spread throughout different issues, and distilling an idea to its core concepts is sorta my super power. ðŸ¥°
