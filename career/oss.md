    > Regardless of  your location along on your professional journey, open source can accelerate your career and make it more resilient. Carlisia Thompson, Senior Member of Technical Staff at VMware, recently spoke about this topic at the Women Transforming Technology Conference.


- [Carlisia on Twitter: "I think we could say there are more jobs in closed source software than in open source. If that’s so, why should someone make an effort to pursue this more competitive opportunity?" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/carlisia/status/1366147324158771207)
  - [(╯°□°)╯︵ ʇʇoɔsʍƐu on Twitter: "@carlisia For me, it is about the phase of my career. I think I did just fine cutting my teeth in closed source app dev for 15+ years. As I learned things and built apps and systems I saw the places where we all get stuck in the toil. I work in OSS to help remove that toil." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/n3wscott/status/1366201826622599168)
  - [Steve Manuel on Twitter: "@carlisia For me it’s freedom and flexibility. Build what I want, how I want, when I want. Also, you *have to* have the job to do closed source. There are no such preconditions in open source." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/nilslice/status/1366157124481339392)
  - [Brandon Mitchell 💙🇺🇦💛 on Twitter: "@carlisia If you're looking for a job and need money, then certainly keep closed source jobs as an option. Open source for me has a lot in common with public service. Some want to serve a greater good than one company's bottom line." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/sudo_bmitch/status/1366165543519141890)
  - [Joe Beda on Twitter: "@carlisia Lot going on here! A couple of things to consider -- different people get job satisfaction from different things. Open source provides a level of interaction and user engage that is rare in commercial settings. Some people really enjoy that." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/1366162205440315392)
  - [Joe Beda on Twitter: "@carlisia Beyond that, you build a public resume. In closed source your contributions to a product are often obscured. Interviewers can't verify what you did. Also sometimes your project isn't publicly facing! So -- "github is your resume" does carry some water." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/1366162588883587075)
  - [Joe Beda on Twitter: "@carlisia Oh! One last point -- in my experience it is often the case that the code quality for open source is higher than closed source. Others often keep you honest and help hold the quality bar. Balance against the urgency to ship." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/1366163494794526721)
