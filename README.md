## 🏋️‍♀️ Work

### 🙋‍♀️ Planned
- ✅ Figure out when v1beta1 is dropping - [from roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/knative-sandbox/projects/10/views/2)
  - [Release v0.5.0-rc1 · kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.5.0-rc1) is out and the actual release might be cut this week.
- ✅ Figure out the priority of the different Ingress implementations (ie. istio, contour, envoy gateway) - [from roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/knative-sandbox/projects/10/views/2)
  - > I'm going to focus on Contour for Knative v1.6. It'd be great to have someone take on the Istio compatibility work for v1.6 as well. Regardless, that would be next.
  - > Envoy Gateway doesn't seem to be in need at the moment, but it will be beneficial to start work on that once we have the two above working with the beta1 version of Gateway API. It could potentially be the default Ingress that Knative uses? TBD.
- ✅ Sortout tasks from [[2022/gateway-api-beta#Roadmap]] for [[v1.6]] - [from roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/knative-sandbox/projects/10/views/2)
- [ ] [Bump Gateway API version to v0.5.0-rc1 · Issue #306 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/306)
- [ ] [Update Contour Version - figure out if gateway features are behind flags and enable them · Issue #308 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/308)
- [ ] [Add contour continuous testing to net-gateway-api test grid · Issue #309 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/309)
