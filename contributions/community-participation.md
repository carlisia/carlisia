## Podcast host
- Creator and host of [The Podlets - A Cloud Native Podcast About The Podlets](https://thepodlets.io/about/)
    > Cloud native technologies have unique elements. In the greater tech community, there is not only a lack of knowledge of concepts and certain technologies, but also misunderstanding and almost mysticism surrounding the space. The Podlets show aims to elucidate and demystify these elements to help people confidently embrace cloud native technology.
