    > Carlisia Thompson is a senior OSS engineer at VMware and host of The Podlets podcast. We cover the unique path Carlisia took from her childhood in Brazil to becoming an influential member of the Go community. She shares her thoughts on the value of traditional education,  her journey to a graduate CS degree, and offers valuable advice for anyone who is looking to get into software engineering.

- [TBS\[16\]: Velero - Crossplane - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV_2QoMRqGw&list=PLDG197Zc9qRTSISBK5XaIYGO_YhrMg6ZX&index=6)
    > Dan is joined this week by Carlisia Campos and Nolan Brubaker, engineers and maintainers on the Velero project. Velero allows you to backup and migrate Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. Crossplane recently underwent architectural updates to allow its users to backup and restore their managed service resources across clusters using Velero. With these changes, users may now snapshot the state of their cloud provider infrastructure, and restore it in the case of cluster failure. We will take a look at how Velero enables this functionality, as well as how the project supports other use-cases across the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- [Learn from our maintainer: build/run/test your Velero code locally and in cluster - VMware Cloud Native Apps - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aiz9M4aVFdA&list=PLDG197Zc9qRTSISBK5XaIYGO_YhrMg6ZX&index=7)
    > In this new "Learn from our maintainer" series, Carlisia shows how quick the developer build/run/test workflow can be when you run the Velero server locally. She does a detailed (read long!) show and tell of how to setup this workflow. She starts from the beginning, from installing the Velero CLI and installing Velero in a local (Kind) cluster, and explains all the commands and flags as she goes along. She also explains and shows (almost) everything that happens in a Kubernetes cluster as the result of changes to code and to configurations as she switches to bundling code changes in an image and pushing it to a cluster. Octant 0.12.0 is highly featured in this demo!

    > Have you ever considered that open source can be not only a career path, but a career accelerator? Do you think you don't have what it takes to get started in a paid open source position? I will share with you steps you can take to start moving in the direction of being a sought-after open source candidate. I will also give you insightful reasons for you to be excited about doing so. I want you to end this talk considering some significant personal satisfaction and career leverage that only open source can provide.

    > Would it surprise you to know that your operational team is experimenting with Kubernetes right now? Likely not. But what if I tell you your developers have also started to look beyond containers and into Kubernetes to improve productivity? Kubernetes isn’t only helping organizations manage and scale production environments. It is also helping make developers more productive and the products they are building more robust. In this talk, I am going to show you why.

    > Historically, formal disaster recovery (DR) plans were only feasible for large enterprises. They could afford to allocate time, resources and the cost of duplicating a datacenter infrastructure.    With the popularity of public cloud and cloud native technologies, the cost and complexity of DR planning has been significantly reduced. This means every company, large and small, can engage in business continuity planning. Why is this important? These are some of the reasons:    Machines and software fail  - People make mistakes  - Hackers prey on the vulnerable  - Weather, fire, terrorism, more...  - You lose customers when there are outages and data loss   - Legal standards often require data retention    This talk will focus on:  - Items that need to be backup and why - some might surprise you  - Why you need selective restore capability  - Existing tooling to simplify and automate a DR strategy

    > "The Go community is fairly homogeneous and missing out on what a more diverse community can accomplish. More diversity can have a greater impact on our community’s ability to be more innovative and creative, and to find solutions to problems we don’t even know we have yet. With this in mind, GoBridge was created to focus on initiatives that provide safe and accessible environments for a variety of people to learn from each other. In this talk I will share the different initiatives GoBridge volunteers are working on to increase adoption of Go and diversity in our community, and suggest super simple ways to contribute."
