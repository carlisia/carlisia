## 🪣 Backlog

### [[networking]]

#### [[net-gateway-api]]
- ask Kanjiro for a deep dive ♥‿♥
- create a listing of learning resources - share it with [[downstream]] ♥‿♥
- add gw tests for the new contour/envoy - better supported kourier, still doesn't support our kingress, long term we might not need to support kourier [[DP]] ♥‿♥
  - we can deprecate kourier in favor of the above
  - watch the last [[TOC]] update for networking group
- would be interesting to create 2 gateways in contours, 1 loadbalance service, 1 cluster ip service - do a manual test - would be nice bc you could say no need to have two copies of contour to have internet exposed [[EA]] ♥‿♥
- [ReconcileIngressFailed in Serving kind e2e testing · Issue #275 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api · GitHub](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/275) (seems hard, need to watch 2 walkthru recordings from [[DP]]) (-_-)
- installation guide (improvement) - https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/292 (-_-)
- [Test Evan's net-contour PR to run tests locally - see gh action scrips as example to add metllb: Add nightly build to run e2e tests against Contour main by sunjayBhatia · Pull Request #728 · knative-sandbox/net-contour](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour/pull/728/files) [[testing]] ♥‿♥

#### [[net-contour]]
- remove contour operator [May 3rd, 2022](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/5ec5a698-cb15-11ec-8957-a6b52dd98539) ♥‿♥
- add loglevel as well double check that net-contour has this as well: [https://github. com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/issues/740](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/issues/740) ♥‿♥

#### [[gateway-api]]
- [Indicate a new Route "Readiness" condition · Issue #1156 · kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1156) ♥‿♥
- [Improvement to the website description of what a Gateway API is and is not · Issue #1157 · kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api · GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1157) (-_-)

### [[support]]
- add links from these pages to rainbow.io:
  - [ ] [support references and troubleshooting](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/ad25a434-8ff9-11ec-a4cd-0ac1ffe50cf3?tag=support) ♥‿♥
  - [ ] [test grid](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/d2bc5198-8fae-11ec-927c-0ac1ffe50cf3?tag=support) ♥‿♥

### [[automation]]
- dependabot: do we need to add it to the net-* repos to auto update the dependencies? ♥‿♥
- seems the pr labeling automation is not picking up nested folders under directories with [[networking]] owners files in the [[serving]] repo. could also be useful for the [[gh queries]] to search on that label instead of iterating over owner files in the serving repo ♥‿♥

### [[contributor]]

  - get back to krna about health files propagation
  - get back to mauricio

- issue triage + search query across all networking repos for good first issue for the WG
