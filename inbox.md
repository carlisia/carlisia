- installation guide (improvement) - [Improve installation documentation · Issue #292 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/292) ¿ⓧ_ⓧﮌ
- ask Kanjiro for a deep dive ♥‿♥
- create a listing of learning resources - share it with [[downstream]] ♥‿♥
- we can deprecate kourier in favor of the new contour/envoy?
- would be interesting to create 2 gateways in contours, 1 loadbalance service, 1 cluster ip service - do a manual test - would be nice bc you could say no need to have two copies of contour to have internet exposed [[EA]] ♥‿♥
- [ReconcileIngressFailed in Serving kind e2e testing · Issue #275 · knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api · GitHub](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-gateway-api/issues/275) (seems hard, need to watch 2 walkthru recordings from [[DP]]) (-_-)
- [Test Evan's net-contour PR to run tests locally - see gh action scrips as example to add metllb: Add nightly build to run e2e tests against Contour main by sunjayBhatia · Pull Request #728 · knative-sandbox/net-contour](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour/pull/728/files) [[testing]] ♥‿♥

#### [[net-contour]]
- remove contour operator [May 3rd, 2022](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/5ec5a698-cb15-11ec-8957-a6b52dd98539) ♥‿♥

### [[support]]


### [[automation]]
- [ ] seems the pr labeling automation is not picking up nested folders under directories with [[networking]] owners files in the [[serving]] repo. could also be useful for the [[gh queries]] to search on that label instead of iterating over owner files in the serving repo. will track it here [[notes/owners file]] ♥‿♥

### [[contributor]]
- suggest a triage process to ensure issues get responded to (-_-)
- issue triage + search query across all networking repos for good first issue for the WG
### [[pr reviews]]
- guy who needs help with test
- write up blog post on how to respond to PRs as a maintainer (vis a vis the guy who needs help with tests) [[contributor]]

### planning
- update gh project board
- Add issues to each item in the gh bets board
- update [Knative Serving Bets Breakdown - Feb 2022](https://github.com/orgs/vmware-tanzu/projects/37/views/1) with new tasks
- change Mark's 1.1 meeting time[[MF]]
