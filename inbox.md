## ðŸª£ Backlog

- [[automation]]
  - dependabot: do we need to add it to the net-* repos to auto update the dependencies?
  - release chcklist
  - gh health files
  - pr automations: seems the pr labeling automation is not picking up nested folders under directories with networking owners files. could also be useful for the gh pr search query to search on that label instead of iterating over owner files in the serving repo

## ðŸ’ƒ Would be fun
- create a macro to generate the weekly log (file name, title)
- create a km macro to paste the weekly log headers
- netfly this site [Gatsby | Netlify CMS | Open-Source Content Management System](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/gatsby/#add-netlify-cms-to-your-site)
- worklog improvement: [Code blocks and syntax highlight Â· Issue #5 Â· hikerpig/foam-template-gatsby-kb](https://github.com/hikerpig/foam-template-gatsby-kb/issues/5)
