# owners file

There seems to be an issue with the pr labeling [[automation]]: automation is not picking up nested folders under directories with [[networking]] owners files in the [[serving]] repo. could also be useful for the gh api queries to search on that label instead of iterating over owner files in the serving repo. will track it here






[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[automation]: ../../oss/automation.md "automation"
[networking]: ../../knative/networking.md "networking"
[serving]: ../../knative/serving.md "serving"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
