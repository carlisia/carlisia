# envoy
To aid in understanding [[kubernetes-networking]], [[service-mesh]], [[gateway-api]], it will be helpful to know what Envoy does and how it works. Comparing it with [[ingress]] would also be helpful.
## Use cases
- [Tech Talks Episode 11: Let's talk service mesh, with Kelsey Hightower - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3nuGTbF-Is)
  - Great conversation that covers what the needs are for having a service mesh. Envoy sits under very popular service mesh technology.

  In this intro to Envoy, Constance will conduct a live demo in which she: - Builds a simple Envoy configuration and explains what each component does. - Runs the configuration using the Envoy docker container. - Sends traffic through Envoy. - Provides an overview of Envoy's observability and administration output. - Covers additional resources for further learning

Envoy provides advanced load balancing support, including eventually consistent service discovery, circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting, and zone-aware load balancing. Envoy also has best-in-class observability, using statistics, logging, and distributed tracing. Since becoming OSS in 2016, Envoy has gained substantial traction in both "service mesh" and edge (API gateway) deployments. In this talk, Matt Klein will dive deep into Envoy internals from a systems perspective, covering threading model, stats, hot restart, the xDS APIs, and other core concepts. This is an advanced talk and prior knowledge of what Envoy is at a high level is assumed.
