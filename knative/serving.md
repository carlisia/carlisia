## Knative serving runtime post Kubernetes Gateway API
[[questions]]: what does Knative bring to the table post [[gateway-api]]?

### A: Knative Serving-as-a-runtime benefits (by [evankanderson (Evan Anderson)](https://github.com/evankanderson), on 05-31):
- Revision management, and ability to roll back one or multiple releases.
- Mapping services to HTTP Routes is break-even
- Makes tagging / canary exposure on a different domain name easier
- Simplifies mixing of environment (cluster) with app template (workload manifiest)
  - For example, HTTPRoute has a hostnames field that needs to vary per-environment. Knative’s config-domain plus context-relative suffixes means you don’t need to override hostname per-environment
- For non-Java applications, automatic health checks. This may soon include automatically determining the port via /proc/net/tcp
  - Safe shutdown (lame duck period) without needing user code involvement
  - Safe (verified) deployment cutovers vs Gateway-API. (Not just the Ready problem, but also the clusters vs routes xDS services.)
    - This is an implementation detail, but we test to ensure this implementation detail works.
- For non-Flagger applications, refuses to roll out configurations that don’t become healthy
- Improved scaling:
  - Concurrency-based scaling
  - Scale to zero when desired
  - 6s / 60s scaling window vs 1m / 5m for HPA.
- Support for automatic HTTPS provisioning
