- upgrade to beta
- continue the discovery work to surface features that are needed/desired and that are missing or broken
- cross-team collaboration to ensure needed features are implemented
- net-gateway-api "readiness"
  - there's an efficient path for "plugging in" the EG or any other project
  - exercise of making Istio and Contour work side by side in that component now I think is going to be very helpful to move faster later. Hooking up 1+1 vendor is a lot more complex than just 1 as we know, and right now the structure of the project is oriented for just 1.
  - visibility on what each integration is lacking as far as Knative needed features
