## Notes
In this PR:

Major changes:

- Edited the instruction text for improvements
-

Minor changes worth noting:

- changed the PR used as reference to add/remove leads, existing one didn't update the `OWNERS_ALIASES` file
-

Notes:

- In INSTRUCTIONS.md, I removed the subsection below from section `## 14 days prior to the release` because it is also in the section `## 7 days prior to the release` and seemed to be unintentially duplicated.

        `### 2. Announce the imminent `pkg` cut`
```
