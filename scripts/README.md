# scripts

## How to use
There are so many different ways to automate the invokation of a script. I  more frequently use these by having a listing of their paths on a file [[ongoing#Scripts]], then:
- hitting a shortcut to go to the line where the path to the script I want to run is
- hitting a shortcut to run the command on that line

## Requirements
- Most if not all of these scripts require the [GitHub CLI | Take GitHub to the command line](https://cli.github.com/)
- Some scripts use [nosarthur/gita: Manage many git repos with sanity](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita)
  - These are my configs for it: [dotfiles/gita/.config/gita at main Â· carlisia/dotfiles](https://github.com/carlisia/dotfiles/tree/main/gita/.config/gita)

## todos
- [ ] remove the bits that repeat
- look at [[gh-queries]] for alternative ways of querying the API
- maybe turn this into a CLI app
